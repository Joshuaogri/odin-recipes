# odin-recipes
A recipe page for an hypothetical odin-kitchen
The main aim of this project is to attempt to make use of the various html tags and tools to design a recipe page. its aim isnt exactly targetted at flamboyance but to sort of demonstrate a basic understanding of html principles. It will be barebones but intends to capture what has been explained. i particularly will like to see how this process helps in sharpening the way i engage with git and github.
